# Genetic Algorithm applied to making a College Schedule

## Authors: Sara Stojkov & Marko Milutin

## The task
Implement a genetic algorithm in Python to create a timetable for university lectures and exercises. Each event must be assigned a day, time, and classroom, following these constraints:

A minimum 15-minute break between events in the same classroom

Classes run only from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, Monday to Friday

The goal is to maximize the product of the average idle times before the first and after the last event for each classroom and day. Input data is provided in _data_timetable.txt_. No GUI is needed — focus on the core algorithm.

Document the project (2–5 pages) describing the program structure, problem constraints, mutation and crossover operators, selection strategy, parameter choices, and algorithm results.

## Implementation

1. The population

2. Fitness Function

3. Mutations

4. Breeding
